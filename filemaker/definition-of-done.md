# FileMaker Solution Definition of Done

**Draft**

A FileMaker development ticket can be considered done if all of the following questions can be answered with “Yes”:

- Do you have confidence in your understanding of what the development ticket is asking of you?
- Are you done developing/updating the solution for the task?
- Have you evaluated possible unexpected interactions of your solution changes?
- Will your future self or your co-workers understand the cleverness you used in your solution?
- Has the feature or bug fix been functionally tested?
- Does the change meet the acceptance requirements of the business?
- **Placeholder for any work needed for file-archiving etc. of the solution**
- Have you functionally tested any related solutions that could be affected by the new/updated solution?
- Have you delivered the solution to the test environment?
- Has the development ticket been updated to “Delivered” status?

Note that if a development ticket ends up being rejected, then the ticket was not actually done. If this happens, attempt to identify what part of the DoD was incorrectly answered “Yes”.
