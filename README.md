# FreshRealm Coding Standards and Guidelines

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository and documents are to establish a baseline set of standards and practices that the FreshRealm Engineering Team will follow. Most of these standards and practices are guidelines, and none of them are set in stone. If you ever have questions, concerns, or recommended changes, then please communicate them via comments within this document itself or directly to the Senior Engineering team.
