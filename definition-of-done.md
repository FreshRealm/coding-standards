# Definition of Done

A development ticket can be considered done if all of the following questions can be answered with “Yes”:

- Do you have confidence in your understanding of what the development ticket is asking of you?
- Are you done writing code for the task?
- Have you evaluated possible unexpected interactions of your code changes?
- Will your future self or your co-workers understand the cleverness you used in your solution?
- Have unit tests been written for all business logic?
- Are unit tests passing?
- Has the feature or bug fix been functionally tested?
- Does the change meet the acceptance requirements of the business?
- Have you merged the current development branch back into your feature branch?
- Have you run all tests after merging development and do they all pass?
- Have you delivered the updated code to the test environment?
- Has the development ticket been updated to “Delivered” status?

Note that if a development ticket ends up being rejected, then the ticket was not actually done. If this happens, attempt to identify what part of the DoD was incorrectly answered “Yes”.
